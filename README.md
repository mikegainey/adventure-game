From the Raspberry PI online course: Object-oriented Programming in Python: Create Your Own Adventure Game

So far, this is just my exploration of how to write an adventure game.  There is no objective or way to win.  More than trying to make a fun game, I'm exploring how to organize my code in a nice way.  So far, the code is way too messy for me to feel good about it

The commands below show the functionality in the game so far.  
```
